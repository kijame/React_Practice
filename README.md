## This repository is made to track the projects I build over the course of Stephen Griders Udemy React Course

I will add descriptions and instructions to run each of the projects in the future!

currently everything can run without additional setup except "video", "pics", and "streams"

they will need some minor configuration regarding their keys, and for streams its mock server.
